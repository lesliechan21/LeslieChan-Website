        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">BiochemistryðŸ§¬</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4"> My name is Leslie Chan. I am a fourth-year undergraduate biochemistry student here at the University of California, Riverside. I am from San Diego, California. Iâ€™m bilingual; I can speak English and Chinese. My hobbies include swimming, badminton, traveling, cooking, playing the piano, and drawing. Throughout my four years as a biochemistry major at the University of California, Riverside, I have focused my coursework on chemistry, biology, and biochemistry and am familiar with conducting labs. During my time in my universityâ€™s honors program and after, I have never missed a deadline for projects and assignments and have demonstrated great attention to detail and a strong work ethic. I am trying very hard to work towards a stable career to support myself and my family.<br><br>

        I chose biochemistry as my major because I thought I wanted to be a pharmacist. However, throughout my college career, I found my true interest and did not want to be a pharmacist anymore. Even though my options are still open, I am now working towards going into the pharmaceutical or biotech industry. I believe biotechnology is important because biotechnology utilizes cellular and biomolecular processes to create technologies and products that help improve our lives and the nature. By making useful food, such as bread and cheese, and preserving dairy products, we have done these for many years by now. Recent biotechnology develops breakthrough products and technologies to fight diseases, reduce our environmental harm, feed the hungry, use less and cleaner energy, and have safer, cleaner, and more efficient industrial manufacturing processes. I also think the pharmaceutical industry is important because they strive towards innovative new treatments that help people live longer and healthier lives. These therapies are developed, manufactured, marketed, and distributed around the world by pharmaceutical companies every day. Overall, I just want to improve the lives of people and contribute to scientific advancements.<br><br>

        To pursue my goals, during this summer, I was a part of the Bioprocessing Summer Undergraduate Internship Training and Education program at the Keck Graduate Institute. In this internship program I developed my skills in team collaboration, extensive research, and presentation. I was tasked to complete a presentation based on the information that was given on a daily with a team of 10. I actively engaged in group projects and helped manage our schedules to reach deadlines. I have also worked on my data collecting skills from a data science bootcamp as well as my academic courses in UCR. These experiences have refined my computer language skills such as Python and R Studio. Outside of academics, I had previous experience as a teacherâ€™s aide at the Gateways summer school program. I had led a class of 30 elementary school students to conduct art projects step by step. It was also my responsibility to properly dissipate and help resolve conflicts that occurred between students. This job experience helped me build on my leadership and interpersonal skills. I am currently looking for a full time job or internship in pharmaceutical or biotechnical fields after graduation.
